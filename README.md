# AI_Image_Generator-mern
MERN based AI image generator app just like Midjourney and Dall-E.
This project is built using mern stack where I have created a web app which can create ai generated images by giving a prompt as an input to it and 
after creating it you can share it as a post on community also you can manage your created posts.

## How to start

Clone repository in your ide make sure you have your own cloudinary,openAi api keys and also nodejs,mongodb atlas uri

Now create a .env backend file with these variables
URI=

After this go to backend directory and type npm install in your terminal
nodemon server.js to start server

npm run dev to start react project

go to localhost:3000 to view the whole web application
