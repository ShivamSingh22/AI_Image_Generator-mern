# AI_Image_Generator-mern
MERN based AI image generator app just like Midjourney and Dall-E.
This project is built using mern stack where I have created a web app which can create ai generated images by giving a prompt as an input to it and 
after creating it you can share it as a post on community also you can manage your created posts.

## How to start

Clone repository in your ide make sure you have your own cloudinary,openAi api keys and also nodejs,mongodb atlas uri

Now create a .env backend file with these variables
- URI=
- OPENAI_API_KEY=
- CLOUDINARY_NAME=
- CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
- CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

After this go to backend directory and type npm install in your terminal
nodemon server.js to start server

Now go to frontend directory and type npm install in your terminal
npm run dev to start react project

go to localhost:8080 to view the whole web application

#Challenge your imagination, give a prompt and click Generate.
